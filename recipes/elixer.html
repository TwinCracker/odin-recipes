    <h1> Who is he?</h1>
    <p>     The Elixir Golem was designed after a scrapped concept, which involved a monster constructed entirely from Elixir. It was also originally called "Elixir Monster". According to a Clash of Clans community manager on Reddit, the Elixir Golem was prototyped during the development of TH12 in Clash of Clans.       </p>
