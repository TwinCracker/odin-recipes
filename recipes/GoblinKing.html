    <h1> Who is he?</h1>
    <p> The menace of clash of clans, the royal goblin that went missing for years finally resurfes. The years that he has been gone were all due to training. This champion is all about speed and damage, which makes up for his low hp. Goblin King's ability allows him to throw down a smoke bomb and call in his two guards the Gobyguards, almost like the cage Goblin except less fast and very low damage, with medium hp to help tank for their King. The smoke bomb effect is like a zap except it deals no damage just makes the enemies retarget onto the Gobygyards. The Goblin King is cheap to play as well, but his ability reinforcement will cost 3 elixir. </p>
